KeepNotes Kotlin App

### Problem Statement:

As a student, you take a lot of notes. Managing those notes can become very difficult if one is not careful and very organized. Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

### Proposed Solution :

Our main objective was to provide students with all the tools they need to take dynamic notes without over complicating the app with unnecessary features.
We want to allow the students to focus their time and attention to absorbing content from lectures and not on overcoming cumbersome app impairments.
So we Created an offline mobile application that makes this process easy.
Every notes is automatically organized into sections which contain pages â€” letting you decide visually how you want to arrange your notes. Keep one section for your song writing, another one for recipes, or start jotting down plans for your next vacation or the new school year. Notes makes it easy to keep tabs on everything in your life.

### Functionality & Concepts used :
1. Room Persistence Library - To store Notes created By the User.
2. Navigation component - To move between different fragments in-app. 
3. Data Binding - To access the views directly and The accessing of view reduced the overhead and the app performance
increased drastically.
4. Recycler View - To Display the notes stored By the user
5. Coroutines - To  perform database related operations asynchronously (Database Operation Include insert/delete/deleteAll/update/retrieve ALl)
6. Material Design Library - Used throughout the app to maintain Consistency with Android Design Guideline 
7. Dark Mode (Night Mode) - Saves Battery and Reduces strain on eyes.
8. LiveData & Room Database : We are also using LiveData and Room Database.

Over the past few years, things have changed dramatically. The major reason behind the major changes is due to technology. Well, if we are talking about technology, mobile apps play a major role in this. Whether it is tracking health or streaming a new track, it is all shifted to an app.

When remembering the most information at a meeting or on lectures, then people do usually end up writing down quickly the keynotes, although, it is not an easy task to synchronize the writing speed when somebody speaks. But where all these writing stuff go? People usually lose them or forget them.

Next we plan to add features like sync notes across devices, notifications for task deadlines, habit tracker, sync or integrate local or google calender in the app, add widgets to the home screen of android device.
